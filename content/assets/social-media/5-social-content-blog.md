<p class="pb-3">Maintaining an active Blog on your site is a required monthly action item in your online marketing plan. Blogging serves two important strategies, providing industry related news and events about your company and the ongoing addition of keyword search phrase content pages to your site. Each Blog post creates a new web page that is Search Engine Optimized as well with Title Tags, Meta Descriptions, Meta Keywords, Image Names and keyword Alt Text.</p>

<p class="pb-3">Your SEO Manager’s team posts two to four in-depth articles per month related to your industry and newsworthy to your target audience. Once the articles are approved, the posts are uploaded to your Blog page. The content will increase the keyword ‘weight’ or ‘density’ of your site and further promoting keyword rankings and search visibility. All posts contain URL’s (backlinks) to your site and have a mix of targeted keywords and phrases to maximize the Search Engine Optimization effect with the Search Engines and your keyword search rankings.</p>
