<p class="pb-3">LinkedIn has grown from an online business contacts listing and resume posting site to become the top social networking destination. It is designed specifically for the business community. The goal of the site is to allow registered members to establish and document networks of people they know and trust professionally. Each month, Search Marketing Resource will amend content posted to your other Social Media accounts and update your LinkedIn business page.</p>

<p class="pb-3">By adding keyword rich copy to this media forum, we continue to add indexable content related to your website and increase your backlink count. The Social Media ‘Share’ icon provides End-Users with a simple way to share content socially across the web and sync up with their friends and followers. With just one click, any visitor to your site can quickly send your company’s website URL, News post or Blog article to family, friends and colleagues. The share icon is a very effective way to increase your online visibility within the top social media directories like Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>
