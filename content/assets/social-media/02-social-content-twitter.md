<p class="pb-3">Twitter has evolved into much more than just an instant messaging tool; it has become a valuable viral marketing, communications and customer service online broadcasting medium. Businesses are routinely posting Tweets, engaging with other users and monitoring competitor’s communications and followers. In tandem with the management of your Facebook account, the Social Media program provides ongoing Tweets added to your Twitter business account.</p>

<p class="pb-3">Monthly, we post 8-10 Tweets to your account listing page. Each Tweet has targeted keywords included and a hyperlink back to your website. The Social Media ‘Share’ icon provides End-Users a simple and easy way to share content socially across the web and sync up with their friends and followers. With just one click, any visitor to your site can quickly send your Company’s website URL, News post or Blog article to family, friends and colleagues. The share icon is a very effective way to increase your online visibility within the top social media directories like Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>
