<p class="pb-3">A significant percentage of your target market is spending more of their search efforts on Facebook and less time on other online channels and Search Engines. Additionally, your competition, whether it is Consumer, Retail, Business-To-Business or Industrial, are active on Facebook and building their online ‘Brand’ and recognition. Included in our Social Media writing services, your SEO Content Manager creates a business listing account for your company if not already active.</p>

<p class="pb-3">Each month we write and upload several in-depth articles that are industry-related and specific to a company event or offering. All posts contain URL’s (backlinks) to your site and have a mix of targeted keywords and phrases. This maximizes the website’s Search Engine Optimization effect and your keyword search rankings. </p>
