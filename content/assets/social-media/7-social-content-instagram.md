<p class="pb-3">Routinely making ‘noise’ about your company by publishing optimized content through various venues continues to promote your website with the Search Engines. Again, Google, Yahoo and Bing typically rank businesses higher in search results who are actively posting news, videos and images specific to their product and service lines. Included with our Search Marketing programs is the creating and posting of keyword tagged videos.</p>

These videos will be indexed by the Search Engines and presented in search results and ‘shared’ to other social media venues.</p>
