    Whether redesigning your existing site or launching an entirely new brand,
    the first step is understanding the needs and wants of your target audience
    and tailoring the website content and functionality to their perspective.

  <p className="pb-3">
    Reviewing your competitors’ websites to see what best practices are being
    employed is a sensible way to make sure you are aligned within your
    industry. Talking with your current customer base to learn the pluses and
    minuses of your website’s End-User experience may also uncover changes to
    your redesign approach.

    Additionally, defining the goals and purpose for the new website helps
    provide a clear path to the page content and functionality.
