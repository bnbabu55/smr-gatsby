  <p className="pb-3">
    A Senior Graphic Designer is assigned to your project to conduct a design
    interview with your team. The meeting will include a review of the website
    navigation (site map), estimated page copy, stock images and your design
    preference, using examples such as other websites, mock-ups or specific
    attributes including colors, shapes and font styles.
  </p>
  <p className="pb-3">
    From this discussion, the design lead will create and present a homepage
    graphic mock-up that blends your favored design attributes of the examples
    you submitted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once a final mock-up is approved, the process will repeat and continue for
    all the interior pages of the site until the entire website design process
    is completed.
