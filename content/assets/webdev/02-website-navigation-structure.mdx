    Once you understand your target audience and the goals of the website, you
    can create a ‘site map’. This can be as simple as a line drawing that
    depicts the page navigation contained within the site and the links to
    offsite locations.

  <p className="pb-3">
    Specific functionality and/or unique content delivery, email opt-in fields,
    video library, secure login areas, PDF downloads, file uploads, contact
    forms, live chat, and online calendaring should be indicated as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    This map provides the direction that will be followed by all involved in the
    project, including the project manager, graphic designer and development
    team.
