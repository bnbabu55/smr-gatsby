    and service line offerings, since your last website was designed. Much of
    your current content may need to be updated or entirely rewritten. The
    amount and type of content incorporated into each page has a big influence
    on the graphic design elements.

    attributes such as Title Tags, Meta Descriptions, Keyword Headers, Keyword
    Page Names, Text Anchor Links, Keyword Image Names, and Alternate Image
    Text.
