    Prior to launching the website, the hosting environment is determined and
    all access credentials provided. If there is a change of host vendors,
    domain transfer or email accounts need to be created, the Search Marketing
    Resource team will manage all requirements.
  </p>
  <p className="pb-3">
    A week before the website is scheduled to go live, both teams will be tasked
    with reviewing and testing all aspects of the new site including grammar,
    image resolution, site links (on and offsite), all plugins or widgets and
    page name URL changes from the previous site.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there are URL changes, redirects will be inserted to maintain keyword
    ranking positions.
