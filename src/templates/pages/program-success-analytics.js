            <p className="pb-3">
              The backbone of any successful digital marketing SEO program is
              the proper selection of keyword phrases to be targeted, and then
              the continued monitoring of their change in ranking position.
              Routinely checking for changes in the market where new or
              different search terms are being used in search queries is also
              critical. Ranking reports are provided each week and the
              performance of each keyword phrase is reviewed for any necessary
              action to increase its ranking position.

            <p className="pb-3">
              Today, Search Engines tend to promote websites with search results
              not only based on the optimization of the site pages, but equally
              important, offsite visibility as well. Creating qualified
              backlinks, or site URLs contained in the copy published on other
              venues, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+ pages and
              Press Releases must be part of an effective Search Engine
              Optimization campaign.

              The Search Engines award bonus points to companies who are active

              News Releases specific to the products and services offered. All
              posts and articles written by your SEO team contain 2-3 links
              pointing back to the website's targeted pages.

              There is a growing audience demographic that relies on Social

              vendors. Facebook likes and reviews are a key part of your
              potential customerâ€™s due diligence before contacting your
              business. Your SEO team will write monthly articles and post to

              The goal of every digital marketing SEO program is to measurably
              increase organic keyword search traffic and â€˜referredâ€™
              click-throughs. These are site visits generated by end-users
              clicking on a link that leads to your site from a different
              website, Social Media page or an optimized Press Release. However,
              while increasing traffic to a website is the cause and effect of a
              successful Search Marketing campaign, turning the visit into a
              sales conversion is the truly desired result.{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="pb-3">
              Your own website has many ways to track its sales conversion
              success. For example, activities like how often site visitors
              complete your Contact Us form, makes a purchase or calls in to
              your offices is a click-through conversion. Additionally, all
              emails from any contact form submissions should be aggregated into

              Beyond the forward-facing copy of a website and the offsite Social
              Media and Press Release SEO efforts, there are many page and
              coding attributes the Search Engines look at in determining search
              ranking hierarchy. This includes the meta content, title tags and
              image-naming convention. We also monitor for duplicate content
              while comparing page to page copy and whether there are any page
